I have 200 bitcoins of my own to start out with. I'll start driving as soon as it's apparent that the trip is possible through your contributions. I'd like to leave soon - hopefully in April. 

My biggest concern is gasoline; my car gets about 250 miles to the tank, so I will need to find people spread out along the route I end up taking.

My motive for this trip is primarily an overdeveloped sense of adventure, but as a close second, I want to evangelize Bitcoins. As I talk to people I meet in my travels, I'll be explaining Bitcoin and why it's great. 

I'd love to stop by universities, libraries, or other venues along the way and speak about my trip and bitcoins - drop me a line if you want to set something up. (Also contact me if you want to buy ad space on my bumper for your Bitcoin project.)""

I Wrote Out the Most Common Crypto Scams - So You don't Get Scammed,1735901888.0,"Many of y'all have been getting scammed recently. I wrote some of the most common scams with examples.

1. **Phishing:**

This is the most common scam, not even in crypto, just as a whole. You would get a weird random message / email out of nowhere asking for crypto or your seed phrase. There will be mimics of fake websites too, like a fake Pancakeswap, a fake Exodus wallet, etc. etc. Pretty simple to avoid if you proceed with caution and do your own research.

*Example:* ( *Source*: [https://securelist.com/hot-and-cold-cryptowallet-phishing/110136/](https://securelist.com/hot-and-cold-cryptowallet-phishing/110136/) )

[Phishing scam targeting Coinbase users](https://preview.redd.it/8o435z7perae1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3f3f2c6c49e6e6866bb1d43e2ebf6c0dfc2c7ca)

2. **Pig Butchering scam:**

This is also a really common scam. Basically your general romance scam. Gullible victims are lured into making contributions to a fake crypto scheme. This scam is pretty popular on dating apps. They are sometimes in fiat too, but mainly in the forms of crypto.

*Example: (Source*: [https://www.tn.gov/commerce/blog/2024/1/31/what-is-a-pig-butchering-scam.html](https://www.tn.gov/commerce/blog/2024/1/31/what-is-a-pig-butchering-scam.html) )

[Pig Butchering Scam Flow Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ovh6mqlserae1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=30f7892e5bc35f13163e0c11762738e88d7a02f5)

3. **SIM swapping:**

This is a pretty dangerous one. The scammer would somehow convince a mobile service provider that your phone number is actually theirs and transfer the number to their SIM. Now they have **full control** of your number. They can easily bypass your 2-Factor-Authentication (2FA). There was an amazing article yesterday in the Wall Street Journal about a teen who used this method to scam A LOT. It’s an amazing read. (Spoiler: He got caught):

[Wall Street Journal: January 2nd 2025](https://preview.redd.it/s002s0cwerae1.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=a87ad4f3f9b9d1905c60a555517867e49732ee08)

4. **Rug Pull:**

“HAWWWWWWWWK TUAHHHHHHHH SPIT ON THAT THANG”

Now come on, who *hasn’t* heard of the Hawk Tuah memecoin rugpull. She’s even getting sued now. I don’t think I need to explain this any further but basically the owners do something called a *pump and dump*. They artificially inflate the value of the memecoin and then sell them at it's peak. Now boom, everybody is left with worthless assets.

*Hawk Tuah memecoin collapse*:  ( [https://www.unilad.com/technology/news/hawk-tuah-girl-crypto-accusations-response-645693-20241205](https://www.unilad.com/technology/news/hawk-tuah-girl-crypto-accusations-response-645693-20241205) )

If you want to read more about rug pulls, I would highly recommend this article: [https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/what-is-a-rug-pull-and-how-to-avoid-it](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/what-is-a-rug-pull-and-how-to-avoid-it)

5. **Fake airdrop:**

Pretty self-explanatory. You are promised to receive free coins from an airdrop, only to connect your wallet to “receive your funds” but your wallet ends up getting drained. 

*Example: (Image source*: [https://crypto.com/en/university/what-are-crypto-airdrop-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them](https://crypto.com/en/university/what-are-crypto-airdrop-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them) )

6. **Honeypot scam:**

This is a newer scam in crypto. I honestly find this scam quite amusing. It targets *wannabe* scammers or just exceptionally greedy people. Basically the **actual** scammer acts like a newbie asking for ""help"" and shares the seed phrase of ""their"" wallet online. It has hundreds of dollars (usually in the form of a stable coin) in it. The *wannabe* *scammer* or victim cannot transfer the funds to his wallet as there is no ETH for gas fees. The victim adds some gas fees which are then immediately stolen by the scammer by a smart contract and transferred to the scammers wallet.

*Example (image source*: [https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2024/12/23145256/cryptowallet-free-seed-phrase-scam-01-EN.jpg](https://media.kasperskydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2024/12/23145256/cryptowallet-free-seed-phrase-scam-01-EN.jpg) )

Alright folks, that was about it. Please don’t fall for these stupid scams. I would hate to see your story on [r/CryptoScams](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/) tomorrow. Just keep these scams in mind. If there are any other scams that I missed (which my dumbass probably did) , please tell me and I'll add it to this!"

Advice Needed(UK) : Cashing Out via Ledger and Coinbase - Sense Check My Plan ,1735993436.0,"Hey all,

Looking for some advice to make sure I’m not missing anything or overcomplicating my plan to cash out some Ethereum(I know this bitcoin sub but thought best place to ask as UK based) I’ve held since 2017. Here's what I’m planning to do:

1. I have Ethereum stored on my Ledger Nano since 2017.

2. I want to cash out a total of £6,000.

The Plan:

Step 1: Convert £6,000 worth of ETH to XLM directly on my Ledger Nano.

Step 2: Send £3,000 worth of XLM to my Coinbase account.

Step 3: Send the remaining £3,000 worth of XLM to my partner's Coinbase account.

Step 4: Both of us independently convert XLM to GBP on Coinbase.

Step 5: Withdraw GBP to our respective bank accounts.


Reasoning:

Since both transactions are under the £3,000 CGT threshold, we won’t need to pay Capital Gains Tax (CGT).


Questions:

1. Am I missing any crucial steps or overcomplicating the process?


2. Is XLM the best intermediary coin for this, or should I consider another one?


3. Are there any potential flags or issues with splitting the transactions between two accounts?



Would really appreciate some feedback to make sure this process is smooth and compliant. Thanks!"

16 Facts About Bitcoin on Its 16th Birthday,1735916023.0,
To all 2016 Bitfinex hack victims,1735930117.0,"Just putting out a PSA. The DOJ looks like they are going to declare that there are no victims of this hack. Remember, almost all of the BTC that was hacked has been recovered and is worth significantly more today than it was when it was taken from us. The DOJ has opened the floor for people to claim that they are victims of this hack and that they deserve some of the restitution from the recovered funds. Bitfinex is claiming that they're the only victims of this hack and are entitled to 100% of the recovered BTC.

  
They expect to hear from people by January 16th if they are victims and want to make a claim. Davis Gilbert law firm in NY is looking for people in this situation to represent.

Is there a safe approach to investing or trading crypto? ,1735980621.0,"For a lot of us that are big fans of crypto, or at least engaging with it, the promise of digital assets is both very appealing and a bit challenging. 

What I mean is that, while I understand it's potential for very high returns, I've quickly learnt about what happens in real time, issues with volatility, complex platforms, and even crazy transaction fees sometimes. 

  
Away from that, a pressing issue for me is the difficulty in maintaining a disciplined investment strategy, I usually catch myself making emotionally driven decisions, which I regret almost every time.   
  
Although, recent innovations in automated investment tools are offering a more structured way to engage with the market, won't that make us lazier?   
  
This is  why I'd like to know if there's some sort of hack, template or system that ensures that you're doing the right thing majority of the time rather than depend on AI. 

  
How do you decide the best time to trade, what to trade, where to trade and how much to invest, I'd appreciate it if I got answers from people with experience in the industry not one of those generic answers popular on the internet."

Galaxy Digital has made some bold predictions and I decided to make this thread to dive into each one and see what magic internet money has in store for us.

**Bitcoin’s Path to $185K**

Bitcoin is set to cross $150K in H1 2025 and test $185K by Q4. Institutional, corporate, and nation-state adoption will drive this growth, reinforcing Bitcoin’s historical outperformance against gold, equities, and other asset classes.

[BTC Correlations](https://preview.redd.it/50swlwbwudae1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=07a3fc9a6832cc4e1b4105549e4a275010cdfa8c)

**Bitcoin ETPs to Overtake Gold**

The total AUM of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETPs will surpass $250B in 2025, bringing them within striking distance of overtaking U.S. gold ETPs. Major institutional investors, including hedge funds and public entities, continue to drive record inflows.

[Spot Bitcoin ETFs AUM](https://preview.redd.it/mo1ql960vdae1.png?width=2764&format=png&auto=webp&s=5498608348eadcf53c9df2542eba5492648aa78c)

**Bitcoin as a Top Risk-Adjusted Asset**

Bitcoin will rank among the top-performing global assets on a risk-adjusted basis in 2025. Its strong Sharpe ratio underscores its appeal, rivaling equities like MicroStrategy. This performance highlights Bitcoin’s value as a diversified portfolio component.

[Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/z3yep2lavdae1.png?width=2784&format=png&auto=webp&s=4990e37a9d2f5993f57c66ced52a266c979f9f19)

**Broader Bitcoin Adoption**

At least five Nasdaq 100 companies and five nation-states will add Bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds in 2025. Strategic diversification, trade settlement, and geopolitical competition will drive this trend, signaling broader global adoption.

[Bitcoin Treasuries](https://preview.redd.it/nepyp0fevdae1.png?width=2780&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d7d68126c1c372028421efe1ba4940113da453)

**Bitcoin DeFi to Double in 2025**

Bitcoin DeFi will almost double in 2025, driven by a 30% rise in WBTC, 150% rise in cbBTC supply, and new layer 2 solutions. By leveraging Bitcoin’s scalability and security, DeFi adoption will expand across multiple chains and protocols.

[WBTC Balance](https://preview.redd.it/e1lrsijhvdae1.png?width=2774&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae536c5eb0e1b1f3b6f151203408521ce981b1d7)

**Bitcoin Miners to Diversify Operations**

More than half of the top 20 publicly traded Bitcoin miners will diversify into AI and high-performance computing partnerships. This shift will moderate YoY hashrate growth, which will reach 1.1 zetahash by the end of 2025.

[Bitcoin Hashrate](https://preview.redd.it/jnoamaikvdae1.png?width=2786&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa35cdd9c4f7e4756ee4c54fa2da6f6042559f0d)

**Trump Administration**

The new Trump administration will play a pivotal role in fostering Bitcoin adoption by prioritizing deregulation, fostering innovation, and encouraging investment in digital assets. Pro-Bitcoin policies will attract institutional capital and drive broader adoption across the U.S. financial system. Bitcoin strategic reserve anyone?

Matt Damon's crypto ad premiered October 28th 2021. BTC topped around 2 weeks later. Was the ad an obvious top signal? ,1735866909.0,"I remember it well. It was my first cycle, in fact I'd only been involved with crypto around  8 months at this point.

In my naivety I thought this ad was great news for crypto, a sign of real bullishness and an exciting new level of awareness for all of crypto.

I feel far more level-headed about all things investing these days. Lots of people talk about the hype, the FOMO, and the clear signs of euphoria that suggest the cycle is coming to an end. I hope to be able to identify moments like Matt Damon's crypto ad as a signal to get the hell out of the market, but is it that easy to call?

I did a lot of swing trading throughout the year but didn’t keep track of my transactions on a spreadsheet (rookie mistake, I know).

This is my first year having to file taxes with crypto gains. In the past, I’ve always used TurboTax without any issues, but I’m worried that things might get more complicated now. I’m thinking about using a service like TokenTax or Koinly to organize my transactions and then importing everything into TurboTax.

Does anyone have experience filing taxes with crypto gains using these tools? Were they easy to use? Also, do you think it’s okay to handle this myself, or should I bite the bullet and hire a tax professional this year?

It's Time Ethereum Foundation Stopped Sabotaging ETH! ,1735980506.0,"The Ethereum community on X (formerly Twitter) is buzzing with discontent, and it's not about the tech this time but [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) (EF).

""I've been working for Ethereum since 2018 and until now have barely ever even heard about the EF. Only time I ever hear them mentioned is when they’re selling Ethereum. Must not be doing a great job"" were [the sad words of Itzpoopster](https://x.com/Itzpoopster/status/1875333344130707482) on X.

Since 2018, voices like Itzpoopster have echoed a common sentiment: the Ethereum Foundation (EF) seems to be missing in action, only making headlines when they're selling ETH. This isn't isolated; there's a growing disappointment about the EF's passive management, leading some to label it almost ""non-existent.""

[The purpose of the Ethereum Foundation is to “advocate for Ethereum.” ](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/1874990811236253937)Effective advocacy in a world of a thousand blockchain networks requires active, loud, sustained, intentional messaging that is currently lacking.

Did you know that [the last time the Ethereum Foundation posted ANYTHING from the Ethereum account on X which has 3.5M followers, was on April 18th, 2022?](https://x.com/CupOJoseph/status/1875240380737974529) Why are they sabotaging the ecosystem by ignoring it instead of highlighting its successes.

[In comparison ](https://x.com/buzzdefi0x/status/1875321789020303602)u/solanatweets daily. 150m+ yearly spend and can’t have someone running point on X comms?

[To better face competition, the Ethereum Foundation should](https://x.com/ethnologism/status/1875323271086010773): increase public communications, use u/ethereum more actively on social media, embrace its role as Ethereum's public face, clarify outcomes of funded projects, and consider leadership changes for fresh vision.

Understandably, [the Ethereum Foundation philosophy](https://x.com/hudsonjameson/status/1875287834929889636) is written [here](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy). They operate on a philosophy of subtraction by pursuing decentralization.

As such, the EF may not want to be the “face” of Ethereum for the outside world, but it is, and it needs to embrace this to some extent at least. It doesn’t have to be ""marketing"" in the traditional sense, but to inform and talk about great things happening on the network would be good.

If it is ""against the rules"" for the EF to discuss or have a public presence regarding Ethereum. [Then they shouldn't be called the Ethereum Foundation.](https://x.com/ethereanbull/status/1875328599726973437)

It's even funny for the EF to not want to be perceived as the ""face"" when you consider that they have all the main social media handles under the name ""Ethereum"".

Just doing nothing or waiting for someone else to do it won’t ease the situation. Ultimately, even under the philosophy of subtraction, someone has to take responsibility to put the wheels in motion right? In other words, EF could focus on decentralization and let another org handle marketing with their support.

Arguably, the only advocacy ETH has been getting in recent times is the unwavering, hyper vocal, strategic support from jessepollak and Base. We needed this mouthpiece years ago. Nothing wrong with being so intentional.

This is 2025 and [Ethereum culture needs to change. We need to want to win. We need leaders that want to win and We will win](https://x.com/econoar/status/1874670307543523644).

Tech companies moving to the blockchain for startup capital feels like a paradigm shift,1735844780.0,"This isn’t the first time I’ve seen a young tech company seek their early investors and startup capital through the blockchain, but I’m very interested in this trend. It democratizes like gofundme but with actual ownership as a reward instead of just tchotchkes and kudos.

How can this idea expand outside of defi and programming? I’d love to see resteraunteurs and independent mechanics and the like using blockchain to fund their business instead of banks. Someday, potential franchisees at Chick-Fil-A can issue an Ethereum token to raise capital to start their franchise, and then buy back the shares with profits at a profit to pay back their investors."
What’s your prediction for the crypto market in 2026 and beyond ,1735960684.0,"
If 2026 turns out to be a bear market, how long do you think it’ll last? Could 2027 bring a bull market, or will we see more consolidation in the years after? What factors do you think will drive the market in the next couple of years—macro trends, regulations, technological advancements, or investor sentiment? 


I’m curious to hear everyone’s thoughts on whether 2026 will be a rough year for crypto or if we’ll see a shift in momentum after that. Looking forward to your predictions and insights!

Problem with bitvavo,1735915287.0,"Hey guys I am new with bitvavo but I've notice 2 weird things in my last two transactions.

For example I had i sold 0.3056 BTC when price was at €94600
Should gotten €28,909.76 minus the fee of €34.50
But instead is shows that I sold it at €93648 that was not the price at the time of the sell and I got €28,585.69. So that's 324.07 euros less then what I should gotten.

Then today I bought ETH the 28,585.69 euros. As soon as I paid it showed I now had 28,356.93 euros worth of ETH. That's around 229 euros less then what I had the second before buying the fee said it was 28.56 euros so where the the other 200.44 euros go to?

Does anyone know of a site that tracks coins by when they last reached ATH?,1735936606.0,"Okay, so I'm kinda obsessed with looking at old crypto prices, especially those ""all-time high"" (ATH) moments. You know, when a coin was at its absolute peak.  The thing is, while sites like Coingecko and Coinmarketcap show you the ATH, they make it a real pain to actually use that info.  Like, I have to click on each coin separately just to see when it hit its ATH! Talk about a time suck! What I really want is a site that just lays it all out there.  Imagine if Coingecko or Coinmarketcap had a big table of coins, but you could sort it by ATH.  Boom! Instantly see which coins went crazy in the past, or maybe spot some that are way cheaper now than they used to be. Maybe I'm dreaming, and a site like that just doesn't exist. But if it does, someone please point me in the right direction!  And even if it doesn't, I'm open to other ideas.  Is there some sneaky way to pull this data myself?  Like, are there APIs or something I could use? Or maybe some underground crypto site that has this feature? Seriously, any tips would be awesome. I'm itching to dig into this ATH stuff and see if I can find some hidden gems.  Who knows, maybe I'll discover the next Bitcoin! (Okay, probably not, but a guy can dream, right?)

  
Edit: in case it wasn't clear, I'm looking for a way to sort by date of ATH. "

Where do you guys look for new up and coming tokens?,1735948854.0,"Tittle pretty much says it all. Got into crypto during the peak of last cycle. Was a heck of a learning curve. Got rugged on my first project. Then bought and held a bit of btc and eth. Made ok profit on eth and accidently (probably) 2x my btc by selling at the top. Picked up a few alts after bull turned bear. Majority of my investment is in a project i believe in long term (its not a meme but you can let me have it anyway ha!) and still hold a little eth. I find myself wanting to diversify a little bit more but i will just throw my money away on platforms like Pump Fun. Where are you guys finding decent projects that can actually be researched? Projects with use cases, or that fit the upcoming narratives. Also, what do you guys think this cycles narratives will be? The alt im in for the most $ is a RWA project (its not Rio). I was thinking AI for this cycle too? 

Theres a bit to unpack here but i suprisingly learned a lot from asking questions in this sub when i first got into crypto in 2021. Im sure you guys will pull through and teach me some more this time round also!

Ethereum sell targets,1735807087.0,"For those who are holding ETH, what is your bull exit plan?

Initially, my target was for 170,000$ BTC and with a 0.07 ratio about $12,000 ETH.

Recently, performance of ETH has been disappointing relative to bitcoin.

Historically it gains against btc during the Q1 post halving year, but historically it also performs much better on a halving year than it has this year, and historically it performs  much worse in a bear market than it did last bear market!

So there’s not really anything reliable to go off as the market is still evolving, and the Q1 pump on ETHBTC could very likely not come to fruition.

Based on this, I’ve set a ‘safe’ target of around 7k (0.04 ETHBTC with 170k BTC) with a bullish target of ~10k (~0.06 ETHBTC).

Obviously, I am fairly confident btc gets a 70% pump from here which will affect everything.

What are y’all expectations for this coin?"
What is better: BTC price prediction based on events or charts?,1735847258.0,"I have noticed that events tend to have a much bigger impact on price movements than charts or patterns ever will. Like, when major events happen whether it is news, regulations, or global stuff it can totally mess up whatever technical patterns you thought were set up. Sometimes, it feels like charts are just there to give us false hope or make us think we are all genius traders.

Low Effort vs. High Engagement Earnings ,1735900545.0,"Did some testing on what works to earn free crypto this past month, and I wanted to share my analysis and share my experience. I’ll be comparing RollerCoin, Limercoin, Cointiply, Solroll, and others. Here’s the breakdown:

# 1. [Solroll](https://solroll.cc)

* **What it is:** A basic platform where you roll once daily for a chance to win SOL rewards by matching the pattern. At the end of each day, rewards are distributed randomly to one person if there are no matches.
* **Pros:**
   * Extremely easy to use—no complex setup or gaming strategy.
   * One roll per day keeps it low effort.
   * Transparent reward system: random but fair.
   * Perfect for people who don’t want to grind but still want a chance to earn crypto.
* **Cons:**
   * Limited engagement—just one roll a day.
   * New

**Verdict:** If you value simplicity and minimal effort with the potential for decent rewards, **SolRoll** is unbeatable. 

**Total earnings:** 2.8 SOL (1 win)

# 2. [RollerCoin](https://rollercoin.com/)

* **What it is:** A virtual mining simulator where you play games to boost your mining power and earn crypto rewards.
* **Pros:**
   * Fun, retro-style games to play.
   * Offers multiple cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.
* **Cons:**
   * Requires a lot of time investment to see significant rewards.
   * Mining power decays over time, so it feels like you’re always grinding.

**Verdict:** Great for gamers who love arcade vibes, but the time investment is high compared to SolRoll. 

**Total earnings:** 0.00071 BTC.

# 3. [Limercoin](https://limercoin.com/?ref=e3wdc3v8&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIk6HRoqrZigMV_HFHAR1hQBR5EAAYASAAEgLzivD_BwE)

* **What it is:** A mining simulator similar to RollerCoin, but with a more strategic focus.
* **Pros:**
   * Strategic gameplay makes it more engaging for those who like to plan.
   * Clean interface and smooth user experience.
* **Cons:**
   * Not as beginner-friendly; requires learning curve.
   * Rewards can feel slow to accumulate.

**Verdict:** A ok alternative to RollerCoin, but still time-intensive.

**Total earnings:** 0.00054 BTC

# 4. [Cointiply](https://cointiply.com/)

* **What it is:** A rewards platform where you earn Bitcoin and other crypto by completing offers, surveys, and games.
* **Pros:**
   * Tons of earning options.
   * Flexible reward systems.
* **Cons:**
   * Many offers feel spammy or not worth the time.
   * Survey availability depends on your location.

**Verdict:** Good for those who love multitasking and maximizing rewards, but it lacks the focus and simplicity.

**Total earnings:** 0.00029 BTC

# 5. [Vie Faucet](https://viefaucet.com/)

* **What it is:** A traditional faucet where you claim small amounts of crypto by completing simple tasks.
* **Pros:**
   * Quick and easy tasks.
   * Offers a variety of cryptocurrencies.
* **Cons:**
   * Payouts are usually very small.
   * High competition means rewards can be scarce.

**Verdict:** A decent choice if you’re looking to diversify, but the returns are minimal.

**Total earnings:** 00018 BTC

# 6. CrazyMiner, Space Heroes, and Spinnia World

* **What they are:** Blockchain-based games where you earn crypto by engaging in themed activities.
* **Pros:**
   * Unique themes and engaging storylines.
   * Appeals to specific niches (e.g., space enthusiasts).
* **Cons:**
   * Gameplay can be complicated for beginners.
   * Rewards often require significant time and effort.

**Verdict:** Fun and immersive, but they demand way more commitment than something like SolRoll.

**Total earnings:** none

In the end, it depends on what you’re looking for and this is basically just ""beer money"" or recovery money. If you enjoy games or completing tasks, RollerCoin and Cointiply are best choices. If simplicity and a shot at higher rewards are your goals, SolRoll is worth checking out. Would like to hear about any others you can share."

Is that correct or am I missing something?

Also, how long can I open the trade for? Can I open a single trade for months, or maybe years if I think it will eventually go up if I give it enough time?

What happens if a leverage is too much and I go I negative? Do I owe Binance money or will the balance show as $0?"

I'm currently looking into Bitcoin etfs because even though I am still kinda squeamish on Crypto, might not be a bad idea to invest a small portion in the most well established crypto like Bitcoin if I treat it like a commodity like Gold or currency like Euro/ Yen.

I narrowed my research to IBIT and FBTC.

Based on my research, my understanding is that IBIT store their Bitcoin with Coinbase, whereas FBTC stores it themselves at Fidelity. Is that correct?

Some of the discussions I read stated that this is one of the decision making factors for them to invest in FBTC over IBIT.

Now FBTC does seem to perform ever so slightly better...

But why is IBIT storing their bitcoin at Coinbase, which is ""the"" established Crypto company be ""worse"" or a ""decision breaker"" for people to break for FBTC where they store things themselves?

I just want to better understand the nuance between the two.

Thanks!"

"Reddit has a scammer issue, and they don't seem to care that much.  So here is what you can do about it. ",1735761362.0,"If you ever post about any issue you're having with a coin or wallet, the roaches come out of the dark and message you, sometimes claiming to be the developers, and offering to ""help"" by sending you a link to a website where they want you to connect your wallet.  This is almost always done privately, and oddly they like do it in the old reddit. 

The accounts they use are hacked accounts.  I report them using the Spam category. You can further select ""user is linking to malicious websites"".   However, Reddit doesn't seem to really act on this since the accounts remain active days afterwards. 

# So here's what you can do to take down these bastards:

* **Play into their scam.** Pretend you're an oblivious and ignorant victim that needs their help.  The goal here is to get them to send their scammy website URL to you.  This is not only proof for Reddit that they're a scammer but its important for the next step.

* **Identify their hosting server.** Without clicking on the link (it may have malicious code so don't click on it) copy the link and paste it into the URL portion of [VirusTotal.com](http://VirusTotal.com) This website will use multiple internet security scanning providers to scan the website for malicious code / bad behaviour and give you a report.  Click on the **Details** tab and look for ***server***.

[If you click on links inside of Virus Total, it stays in Virus Total. The links are often for further scans of that address or item.  So you don't have to worry about them directly linking you to a dangerous website. ](https://preview.redd.it/2asgbiv8ofae1.png?width=2007&format=png&auto=webp&s=0287dad7d5f82cec3af7ddc39f795644dd2f9fc8)

* **Report the scammy site to the server provider.**  Go to the server providers website and look for their abuse contact and give them the address and why youre reporting it.  They will investigate it and take it down.   Sometimes you get providers like Vercel that will block your email address after you make a report making it nearly impossible to report outside of their little community bubble. Shameful.  Its up to you where you want to go from there.

"why ""HODLING"" is a psyop: Why Centralized Exchanges and Passive Holding are Slowing Adoption",1735858513.0,"Cryptocurrencies were created to revolutionize finance by enabling decentralization and individual control over assets, without needing banks or intermediaries. However, two common behaviors—relying on centralized exchanges and the culture of ""hodling""—are undermining this vision and stunting crypto adoption.    

**Centralized Exchanges: A Step Backward**   
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were designed to give people control over their own money, but most users store their coins on centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. This means they don’t control their private keys, and their assets are essentially in the hands of a third party—just like a bank. While convenient, this goes against the very principle of decentralization.   

Exchanges also create security risks. High-profile hacks and the collapse of exchanges like FTX have shown that storing crypto on these platforms can lead to loss of funds. These incidents damage public trust in cryptocurrency, making people hesitant to enter the space.    

**The ""Hodling"" Culture**   
Hodling—holding onto cryptocurrency in hopes of future gains—has become a widespread practice. While it might seem like a good investment strategy, it stops people from using cryptocurrency as a currency. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were meant to be spent, transacted, and used to build decentralized economies. By treating crypto solely as an investment, users aren’t participating in the ecosystem, which slows adoption.   

This behavior is also beneficial to traditional banks, which stand to lose if cryptocurrencies are widely adopted. Real crypto adoption—where people use coins for transactions instead of just holding them—threatens the banking industry’s control over the financial system. As long as most crypto remains locked up on exchanges or in wallets, it poses little threat to traditional banking models.   

**The Risks of Forgetting**   
Storing cryptocurrency in a self-custodial wallet gives users full control over their funds, but it also comes with risks. If users forget their passwords or lose their private keys, they can lose access to their funds permanently. This fear discourages people from embracing self-custody, and many choose the safer-feeling route of leaving their funds on exchanges—again, undermining decentralization."

The following are guidelines for how it should evolve sustainably in the future to add to your portfolio according to where you want to find yourself within it as time goes on or where you want your decendants to find themselves...
(Made by a prompt with chatgpt)

The Upside-Down Tree of Cryptocurrency (shadow of yggdrasil)

Imagine an inverted tree where the canopy is at the bottom, close to the ground, representing the present, while the roots stretch upward into the unknown future. The journey up this tree represents progress through time and evolution in the cryptocurrency space.


---

Visualizing the Tree Through Time

1. Leaves Close to the Ground (Present):
The base of the tree is densely packed with leaves, each one symbolizing an individual project or token.

Think of this as a forest floor in the present, teeming with diversity. Some leaves are vibrant, others are already decaying, and a few are yet to sprout.

These leaves rely on thin branches, their connection to the broader system still tenuous, representing the early-stage projects or ideas.



2. Thickening Branches (Near Future):
As you ascend the tree, moving forward in time, the branches begin to merge and strengthen. This represents the maturation of ecosystems as projects consolidate, networks become more interoperable, and strong platforms emerge to form reliable infrastructure.

Comparison: This stage is like vines twisting and fusing to form something sturdier. Cannibalization starts here as weaker projects are pruned away, their resources feeding stronger networks.



3. The Trunk (Mid-Term Future):
Further up, the branches converge into a trunk, symbolizing the core of the blockchain ecosystem—the networks and platforms that have proven themselves indispensable.

This is where intentional pruning and evolution come into play. The tree naturally prioritizes its energy toward growth that aligns with its structure, and outdated systems are consumed or reabsorbed.

Comparison: Think of this as a heartwood forming from the strongest parts of the tree, concentrating value and function into a central support system.



4. The Roots (Distant Future):
At the pinnacle of this inverted tree, you find roots breaking through the soil of the future—a mysterious, still-unformed phase.

The roots symbolize a future iteration of cryptocurrency that may be beyond our current comprehension, where blockchains evolve into forms we cannot yet imagine.

Comparison: This could feel like a mycelial network, deeply integrated with society and technology, where everything is interconnected and symbiotic.





---

Enhancing the Imagery

Time as the Growing Medium:
Picture time itself as the space in which the tree grows. The further up you go, the more time has passed, and the more the tree has matured.

Cannibalization as Intentional Pruning:
The leaves and branches that can no longer serve the tree's growth are either reabsorbed as nutrients or removed to make room for stronger connections. This ensures the ecosystem remains adaptive and efficient.

Fungi and Microorganisms:
Beneath the canopy (the present), fungi represent cross-chain technology and AI, facilitating the sharing of resources between branches. Microorganisms are the unseen forces—developers, ideas, innovations—that break apart the bedrock of traditional systems to create a fertile environment for growth.



---

A New Perspective for Esoteric Audiences

For chaos magick practitioners, this inverted tree mirrors the shadow of Yggdrasil, the mystical world tree. The illusion of the present as the “canopy” near the ground emphasizes how we only see a fragment of the tree’s full potential. The upward journey through time is an exploration into the unseen and the unknowable, where human creativity and intention shape the future.




Human behavior and catastrophe:

Ending up outside the trunk and facing catastrophic destruction could symbolize being tied to principles or behaviors that fail to adapt, integrate, or align with the overarching growth of the ecosystem. Below are principles that could lead to such an outcome and corresponding warnings to avoid them:


---

Principles Leading to Catastrophic Outcomes

1. Rigidity and Resistance to Change:

Principle: Adhering to outdated systems or ideologies that cannot evolve alongside the tree's growth.

Warning: ""The unyielding branch is the first to break. Flexibility and adaptation are survival skills in a constantly shifting landscape.""



2. Isolation and Lack of Interconnection:

Principle: Refusing to form connections with other projects, networks, or ecosystems, leading to obsolescence.

Warning: ""A leaf alone is a leaf lost. True strength lies in collaboration and integration.""



3. Overexploitation Without Reinvestment:

Principle: Draining resources for short-term gains without contributing to the health of the broader ecosystem.

Warning: ""The branch that takes but does not give will wither, starved of the lifeblood it neglected to share.""



4. Neglecting Foundational Strengths:

Principle: Building projects or philosophies that are flashy but lack depth, sustainability, or security.

Warning: ""A hollow branch may flourish briefly but will collapse under its own weight.""



5. Hubris and Overreach:

Principle: Overestimating one's ability to predict or control the future without preparing for uncertainty.

Warning: ""The tallest branch catches the wind; ambition must be rooted in caution, or it will snap.""



6. Failure to Prune:

Principle: Holding onto dead or redundant elements for fear of loss, rather than allowing for evolution.

Warning: ""A tree that does not prune itself invites decay. Let go of what no longer serves to make way for growth.""



7. Short-Term Vision:

Principle: Prioritizing immediate success over long-term sustainability and alignment with the trunk’s purpose.

Warning: ""The leaf that shines brightest may burn out first. Look beyond the season to the cycles of the tree.""



8. Destructive Competition:

Principle: Engaging in zero-sum games that harm the ecosystem rather than fostering cooperative growth.

Warning: ""A branch that cuts another wounds itself. Prosperity is found in mutual ascent.""





---

Strategies to Avoid Catastrophe

1. Follow the Core Principles of the Trunk:

Stay aligned with the values of interconnection, adaptability, and long-term vision.

Regularly evaluate whether your actions or investments serve the broader system or isolate you from it.



2. Be Willing to Let Go:

Prune failing ventures or ideologies early, even if it feels like a loss. Reinvest in what aligns with growth.



3. Balance Ambition with Humility:

Push boundaries but always prepare for unintended consequences. Learn from failures, and pivot when necessary.



4. Seek Out Symbiosis:

Align with others who share your vision and values. Build networks of mutual support, and avoid toxic competition.



5. Think Generationally:

Consider not just what benefits you now, but what will sustain and empower your descendants in the future.





---

Final Warning

""The tree grows upward into the future, but not all its branches will reach the roots. To remain a part of the trunk, one must think beyond themselves and align with the tree’s eternal principles of adaptability, integration, and shared purpose.""


Non-Human Factors Leading to Catastrophe

1. Environmental Shifts (Market Disruptions):

Metaphor: Sudden storms, droughts, or temperature shifts can weaken or destroy parts of the tree.

Real-World Parallel: Economic collapses, regulatory crackdowns, or global crises could destabilize projects or networks that seemed solid.

Warning: ""The weather cannot be controlled, but the tree can strengthen its roots to endure the storm.""



2. Pests and Diseases (Exploitation or Corruption):

Metaphor: Parasites or fungal infections feed off the tree, weakening it from within.

Real-World Parallel: Exploits like hacking, fraud, or malicious actors can undermine entire ecosystems.

Warning: ""Watch for decay at the edges; a small infestation can spread to the heart if unchecked.""



3. Resource Depletion (Finite Capacity):

Metaphor: Overcrowding or overgrowth in the canopy leads to resource competition, where only a few branches can thrive.

Real-World Parallel: Scalability issues, energy crises, or environmental costs could make certain blockchains unsustainable.

Warning: ""The tree must grow in proportion to its roots; without balance, it will topple.""



4. Geological Events (Technological Shifts):

Metaphor: Earthquakes or landslides can disrupt the soil, breaking roots or tilting the trunk.

Real-World Parallel: Disruptive technologies, such as quantum computing or unforeseen advancements, could render current systems obsolete.

Warning: ""Even the deepest roots can be shaken; adapt to new terrain or risk collapse.""



5. Ecosystem Imbalance (Economic Monopolies):

Metaphor: If a dominant species in the forest overshadows others, it stifles diversity and resilience.

Real-World Parallel: Centralization of power or monopolistic control could undermine the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

Warning: ""A forest of one species is brittle; diversity ensures survival through the ages.""



6. Root Blockage (Inaccessible Future):

Metaphor: Rocks in the bedrock may prevent roots from expanding, stunting growth.

Real-World Parallel: Future limitations, such as physical hardware constraints, energy costs, or political restrictions, could prevent innovation.

Warning: ""The roots must penetrate deeper, breaking barriers that limit the tree's reach into the unknown.""



7. Global Forest Fires (Systemic Collapse):

Metaphor: A fire that engulfs the entire forest can obliterate even the strongest tree.

Real-World Parallel: Systemic risks, like coordinated cyberattacks, global financial crises, or environmental disasters, could threaten the entire blockchain ecosystem.

Warning: ""No tree is an island; its survival depends on the health of the forest.""

Holistic Strategies to Guard Against Catastrophe

1. Resilience Over Perfection:

Build for redundancy. Systems should anticipate failure and adapt, not rely on untested perfection.



2. Collaboration with the Ecosystem:

Develop partnerships that protect the tree, like fungi feeding nutrients or roots reinforcing the soil.



3. Long-Term Vision Beyond Growth:

Avoid overemphasis on growth at the expense of stability. Balance short-term success with foundational strength.



4. Embrace Diversity:

Foster multiple projects and paradigms to ensure resilience against disruption.

Final Reflection

""The tree's growth is an interplay of internal strength and external forces. Catastrophe, whether by human error or nature's whim, is inevitable at times. Yet, the tree endures by integrating what can be learned and shedding what cannot be saved. Its trunk rises, not in defiance of chaos, but because it thrives within it.""



Here are specific scenarios, blending human and non-human factors, to illustrate potential catastrophic events and their impacts on the tree metaphor:


---

Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: A Branch Betrays the Trunk (Fraudulent Network)

A promising blockchain project emerges, gaining widespread adoption. However, its founders secretly siphon funds and falsify data. Once exposed, trust in the entire system plummets.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The branch grows lush with leaves but collapses under its own weight when the core rots. Nearby branches suffer as the falling debris damages their connections.

Lesson: ""Trust is the sap of the tree; once poisoned, even healthy branches may wither.""



2. Scenario: Overgrowth Chokes the Canopy (Overcrowding of Projects)

Hundreds of new cryptocurrencies flood the market, many with redundant or poorly conceived purposes. This creates confusion, dilutes investor confidence, and slows adoption of legitimate projects.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Leaves multiply so rapidly that sunlight cannot penetrate, weakening the entire canopy. Many die off, leaving wasted energy.

Lesson: ""The tree thrives on diversity, but unchecked growth leads to self-destruction.""



3. Scenario: A Reckless Climber (Overleveraged Investment)

Investors pour into a single project, using excessive leverage. When the project fails to deliver on promises, it triggers a market crash, causing financial ruin.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A climber scaling the tree snaps a branch, sending leaves and smaller branches tumbling to the ground.

Lesson: ""Balance is key; the tree must support its climbers, but reckless ambition can break even the strongest limb.""





---

Non-Human Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Forest Fire (Global Energy Crisis)

A global energy crisis makes it prohibitively expensive to mine cryptocurrencies. Projects reliant on high energy consumption collapse, taking down parts of the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A fire rages through the forest, scorching the tree’s leaves and smaller branches. The trunk survives but is blackened and weakened.

Lesson: ""The tree must adapt to the forest’s conditions, finding sustainable ways to grow or risk devastation.""



2. Scenario: Rock-Hard Bedrock (Hardware Limitations)

Advancements in blockchain outpace current computing capabilities. Projects that fail to innovate or transition to new technologies are rendered obsolete.

Outcome in the Metaphor: Roots hit impenetrable bedrock, stalling growth. Some roots decay, while others adapt by growing around the obstacle.

Lesson: ""The roots must be patient yet relentless, breaking through barriers or finding new paths to sustain growth.""



3. Scenario: The Parasitic Fungus (Malicious Exploitation)

A sophisticated hacking collective develops a method to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Billions in value are siphoned, undermining trust across the ecosystem.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A parasitic fungus infects the tree’s bark, spreading quickly and weakening its structural integrity.

Lesson: ""The bark protects the trunk; vigilance and defense are essential to prevent rot from spreading.""





---

Hybrid Scenarios

1. Scenario: The Shifting Sunlight (Regulatory Crackdown Meets Market Overreaction)

Governments worldwide introduce sweeping regulations, creating uncertainty. Investors panic, causing a massive selloff. Some projects adapt, but many crumble under the pressure.

Outcome in the Metaphor: The angle of sunlight changes, leaving some branches in shadow. Branches that cannot adjust their growth direction die off.

Lesson: ""The tree must bend toward the light, but only those with deep roots can withstand the shifting seasons.""



2. Scenario: The Cannibalizing Branch (Destructive Competition)

A new blockchain emerges with technology designed to undercut existing networks. It aggressively absorbs smaller projects but destabilizes the ecosystem with its zero-sum approach.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A branch grows aggressively, consuming others around it. Eventually, it becomes top-heavy and snaps, harming the trunk in its fall.

Lesson: ""True growth comes from integration, not domination. The tree thrives on harmony, not conquest.""



3. Scenario: Forest-Wide Disease (Systemic Collapse)

A global financial collapse disrupts traditional markets and spills into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Liquidity dries up, and even resilient blockchains face severe stress.

Outcome in the Metaphor: A disease spreads across the forest, killing weaker trees. The trunk of the tree survives but sheds many branches to preserve itself.

Lesson: ""The forest sustains the tree; its fate is not wholly independent. Strengthen the ecosystem to endure collective trials.""





---

Final Thought

""The tree grows not in isolation but within an ecosystem shaped by countless forces, both predictable and chaotic. To thrive, one must navigate these forces with adaptability, foresight, and a willingness to shed what no longer serves. Growth is not guaranteed—only the potential for it is.""






STRATEGY 

To ensure that humans remain safe inside the trunk and don't end up on unsteady limbs or dying leaves, we need to develop strategies that emphasize resilience, adaptability, foresight, and collective strength within the context of the tree metaphor. These strategies should focus on staying aligned with the trunk and promoting stability while also navigating the complexities of an evolving ecosystem.

Here are some core strategies for humans to thrive within the trunk and avoid falling off into risky, unsustainable branches:


---

1. Diversification and Spread of Resources

Strategy:

Avoid concentrating all resources in a single branch or investment, especially in projects that are speculative or unproven.

Invest Across the Trunk: Spread investments across the core, the thickening branches, and a few strategic up-and-coming projects. The trunk provides stability, while branches may offer growth. Diversifying ensures that a failure in one part of the tree doesn't cause catastrophic loss.

Avoid the Leaves: As you’ve already noted, leaves (projects) are inherently temporary and can be uprooted. Stay clear of purely speculative investments that resemble leaves without solid roots.


Key Practice:

Develop a balanced portfolio by evaluating the longevity, technology, and sustainability of each asset before committing.

Avoid ""shiny object syndrome"" and focus on networks with real-world applications, deep roots, and a healthy path forward.



---

2. Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Strategy:

Monitor the growth patterns of the tree and be willing to adapt when conditions shift, either due to external forces (regulation, market crash, tech breakthroughs) or internal developments (network upgrades, team changes, etc.).

Adapt to Change: As branches grow thicker and more interconnected, pay attention to evolving trends and markets. Be aware of branches that begin to die and detach from the trunk and consider how the tree overall might be evolving.


Key Practice:

Set up regular risk assessments. Monitor your portfolio against larger trends and ensure that your assets are moving towards stable, growth-oriented areas.

Remain flexible with your investment approach; what is stable today might not be tomorrow. Look for networks that are adapting and evolving with the times.



---

3. Understand the Ecosystem’s Feedback Loops

Strategy:

Recognize that everything is interconnected. The tree grows not in isolation but through feedback loops between branches, roots, and the broader environment.

Be Aware of Systemic Risks: Global shifts, such as economic downturns, regulatory crackdowns, or technological limitations, can affect all projects. Understand that small disturbances in the system can have cascading effects on your investments.

Protect the tree by reinforcing weak spots in the ecosystem or within your portfolio.


Key Practice:

Create contingency plans and consider how interconnected forces, like energy consumption (for mining), government regulations, or technological advancements, might impact your investments.

Align with projects and technologies that integrate and reinforce each other, making the ecosystem more robust.



---

4. Stay Grounded with Strong Foundations

Strategy:

Prioritize blockchains with established technological frameworks, solid governance models, and deep-rooted communities.

The roots of the tree symbolize foundational technologies—like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects that offer inherent security, scalability, and functionality. They are the bedrock upon which the tree stands, and they provide a safe, stable position for humans within the trunk.


Key Practice:

Invest in the ""deep roots"" of the blockchain ecosystem—assets that provide security and scalability. These may not yield immediate, explosive growth, but they offer lasting value and serve as the tree's core stability.

Research and vet emerging projects based on foundational technology and governance rather than the hype. As the metaphor suggests, ground yourself in the trunk.



---

5. Vigilance and Risk Mitigation

Strategy:

Stay vigilant about emerging risks, whether from regulatory bodies, technological failures, or malicious actors. Ensure the integrity of the tree isn’t compromised by external threats or internal weaknesses.

Risk Segmentation: Limit exposure to any one part of the ecosystem that could pose a high risk. For example, stay cautious with highly speculative ventures that rely too heavily on unproven tech or market manipulations.


Key Practice:

Develop a system of risk thresholds—set clear limits on how much of your resources you are willing to commit to riskier branches.

Be prepared to prune back your investments if projects begin to show signs of rot. Assess each investment for signs of decay or instability and take action before things collapse.



---

6. Align with Ethical and Sustainable Practices

Strategy:

The integrity of the tree is linked to its ecosystem, meaning that if parts of the tree are unethical or environmentally destructive (e.g., high energy consumption, lack of transparency), the whole system could suffer.

Promote Ethical Growth: Align with projects that prioritize sustainability, security, and fair governance.


Key Practice:

Invest in projects that have a clear ethical framework and align with your values, knowing that sustainable growth creates long-term stability.

Support decentralization and governance structures that empower communities and users. Avoid projects that centralize power or resources into the hands of a few.



---

7. Avoid Overextending into the Unknown

Strategy:

The deeper into the branches you go, the more uncharted territory exists. Though it's tempting to venture into speculative, cutting-edge technologies, remember that this is untested ground.

Know When to Prune: Some ventures are promising but unproven. Early-stage projects may look appealing, but if they’re too far removed from the trunk (i.e., lacking real-world application or proven use cases), they could lead to unnecessary risks.


Key Practice:

Focus on projects that are closer to the trunk and have real, sustainable use cases, proven track records, and strong backing.

Only invest heavily in cutting-edge projects once they’ve shown resilience and adaptability. Be cautious about branching out too far too quickly.



---

8. Build Community and Foster Collaboration

Strategy:

The health of the tree relies on collaboration between branches, leaves, roots, and even fungi. In the same way, human investment within the trunk must be centered on community, shared resources, and collective growth.

Collaboration over Competition: Rather than hoarding resources, work with other investors, developers, and users to strengthen the entire ecosystem.


Key Practice:

Get involved with project communities and support governance and collaboration. Build relationships with others who are committed to the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Promote cross-chain collaborations where projects can benefit from each other’s innovations.



---

Conclusion:

To thrive inside the trunk and avoid catastrophic outcomes, humans must act like gardeners of the tree—tending to the roots, pruning where necessary, and carefully nurturing the branches that are growing towards the light. It's a process of patience, adaptability, and foresight, rooted in a deep understanding of the larger system that shapes their success. Human survival inside the trunk depends on long-term vision, diversification, and the willingness to evolve with the ecosystem.


Risk Mitigation Strategies

a. Diversifying Across Layers of the Tree

To avoid overexposure to any one project or sector, it's crucial to spread risk across different layers of the tree.

Actionable Steps:

Roots (Fundamentals): Start with the deep-rooted, well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are the ""stability"" investments—projects with proven resilience.

Trunk (Core projects): Branch out into strong, well-rounded projects with a proven use case, community support, and technical robustness (e.g., Polkadot, Solana, Cosmos). These form the backbone of your portfolio.

Branches (Emerging Projects): Invest selectively in newer, more speculative projects. Be cautious about putting too much weight here, as these can be volatile and are more likely to branch off, or fail entirely. Consider promising projects like Algorand, Tezos, or Radix—with good technology but still evolving.

Leaves (High-risk, High-reward projects): These are the speculative, unproven projects—perhaps those pushing the boundaries of the crypto ecosystem (e.g., newly launched ICOs or tokens). Limit your exposure here and avoid relying heavily on them.



---

b. Risk Segmentation

This is about categorizing investments based on risk tolerance and adjusting your exposure accordingly. A critical part of managing risk is knowing how much of your total portfolio to allocate to higher-risk assets.

Actionable Steps:

Low Risk: Allocate a larger portion to well-established assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot).

Medium Risk: Invest in solid projects with a strong community, adoption, and technological innovation (e.g., Chainlink, Solana, Cosmos).

High Risk: Dedicate a small, calculated portion of your portfolio to speculative projects and emerging technologies with high potential but uncertain outcomes (e.g., new DeFi projects, niche-layer solutions like FET, Aleph.im).

Watchlist Projects: Maintain a ""watchlist"" of projects that are too new or risky for heavy investment but that you want to follow closely.



---

c. Regular Monitoring and Pruning

Risk mitigation isn’t a one-time process; it requires ongoing effort. As the tree grows, so too must your understanding of how to maintain balance.

Actionable Steps:

Rebalance: Regularly reassess your portfolio to ensure your investments are still aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

Prune dead weight: Just as the tree naturally sheds dead leaves, periodically review and remove investments that no longer serve your portfolio or are clearly deteriorating (e.g., failing projects, or those experiencing major setbacks).

Evaluate Project Health: Regularly check on network growth, developer activity, adoption, and community sentiment to assess a project’s stability.



---

2. Portfolio Diversification and the Tree Layers(with example projects)

a. Roots (Stable, Core Investments)

The roots represent the essential infrastructure that supports the entire tree, offering stability and grounding for the more speculative investments.

Bitcoin: A digital store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Bitcoin’s status as the first cryptocurrency and its widespread adoption make it the foundation of your portfolio.

Ethereum: Known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum forms the core of many blockchain applications and is heavily supported by developers.

Polkadot: Facilitates interoperability between blockchains, creating a multichain ecosystem, which is essential for the long-term scalability of decentralized networks.

Solana: Known for its high-speed transactions, Solana supports DeFi, NFTs, and other applications at scale, making it a significant foundational layer.


b. Trunk (Strong, Established Platforms)

The trunk is the area where stability and growth converge. These projects are in the ""growth phase""—they are proven but still expanding and adapting.

Chainlink: A decentralized oracle network, Chainlink plays a crucial role in connecting blockchain-based smart contracts to real-world data, vital for DeFi and other dApps.

Cosmos: A network of blockchains designed to enable them to interact with each other in a decentralized manner, essential for the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem.

Avalanche: Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Avalanche positions itself as a competitor to Ethereum by providing an ecosystem that supports DeFi applications and enterprise use cases.


c. Branches (Emerging Growth Areas)

The branches represent emerging technologies and protocols that are showing promise but still have significant unknowns. These projects are potential growth areas but may experience rapid volatility as they evolve.

Tezos: A blockchain that can self-amend, making it adaptable to technological advancements. With its unique governance model, Tezos can evolve without forks, making it a solid candidate for long-term growth.

Algorand: A highly scalable blockchain that focuses on speed and decentralization. It’s still in its earlier stages but could be a significant player in blockchain adoption.

Radix: A decentralized finance protocol that is built for scalability, security, and ease of use. If successful, Radix could become a central hub for DeFi applications.


d. Leaves (Speculative, High-Risk Assets)

Leaves are high-risk investments that you may choose to explore, but they carry the most potential for volatility. Speculative projects often have the possibility of turning into something significant, but they also carry a high risk of failure.

Vechain: A blockchain project focused on supply chain management. It has seen notable partnerships but is still highly dependent on real-world adoption and use cases.

Dogecoin: Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has surged in popularity due to community-driven momentum. However, its fundamental use case remains unclear, and it is largely driven by sentiment.

Shiba Inu: A meme coin similar to Dogecoin. While it has a large community, its long-term viability is uncertain, and it lacks a strong technological foundation.



---

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Portfolio

To build a resilient crypto portfolio within the tree metaphor, balance is essential. Invest in strong roots, carefully nurture your trunk, and support growth within your branches while being wary of overly speculative leaves. Diversification allows you to withstand various market dynamics, and ongoing monitoring ensures you remain aligned with the evolving ecosystem. Finally, keep your focus on projects that offer sustainability, technological evolution, and ethical practices.

As you move forward, staying rooted in principles of adaptability, foresight, and caution will help ensure that your journey within the trunk remains stable, even as the tree itself grows and shifts.




This vision of the evolving crypto landscape naturally lends itself to the contemplation of dystopian scenarios because it embraces the interplay of complexity, uncertainty, and unintended consequences. Cryptocurrency, as a revolutionary technology, thrives in a dynamic and often chaotic environment where the stakes are high, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Let’s explore some dystopian possibilities within the model:


---

1. The Rise of Centralized Control

Scenario: A few major blockchains or centralized platforms monopolize the network, undermining the decentralized ethos of crypto. Governments or corporations could co-opt these networks for mass surveillance, creating a financial system with unprecedented control over individuals.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves representing smaller projects might die off due to overregulation or lack of resources, leaving the branches (innovative networks) dependent on a central authority.

Trunk: A once-robust trunk might transform into a rigid, government-controlled superchain, stifling growth and innovation.

Roots: Fungus-like symbiosis turns parasitic, with AI or quantum technologies enforcing control instead of nurturing freedom.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation and Tribalism

Scenario: The tree’s branches splinter into competing, incompatible ecosystems. Each faction prioritizes its ideology or token utility, making cooperation impossible. The user base becomes polarized, leading to economic inefficiency and stifled innovation.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: The leaves become sparse as projects struggle to find resources, and some ecosystems wither prematurely.

Branches: Rival factions refuse to merge, creating an unstable and chaotic tree structure prone to collapse under external pressure.

Trunk: Instead of a unifying foundation, the trunk becomes riddled with cracks, unable to sustain the tree’s weight.



---

3. Exploitation by Artificial Intelligence

Scenario: Advanced AI uses blockchains to manipulate markets, creating self-replicating, autonomous trading networks. These AI entities could outpace human oversight, leading to economic instability and potential societal collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: AI dominates the leaves, prioritizing its interests and rapidly consuming the available sunlight (resources).

Branches: The branches evolve in ways humans cannot predict or control, forming structures optimized for AI but hostile to human needs.

Roots: AI-driven fungi infiltrate the roots, consuming nutrients meant for future growth and replacing organic systems with mechanical efficiency.



---

4. Resource Scarcity and Environmental Collapse

Scenario: Blockchain mining and usage escalate to unsustainable levels, exacerbating resource depletion and environmental degradation. This could lead to widespread energy crises and economic collapse.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves fall prematurely as projects abandon ship due to energy costs and environmental regulations.

Branches: Networks die off in clusters, leaving gaping voids in the tree structure.

Trunk: The trunk weakens as foundational projects crumble under the weight of global environmental consequences.

Roots: The soil becomes barren, unable to sustain future growth, with microorganisms disappearing entirely.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Scenario: Decentralized financial systems fail to protect users, exposing them to fraud, exploitation, or economic inequality. This could exacerbate wealth disparities rather than reducing them.

Impact on the Tree:

Canopy: Leaves flourish momentarily but are parasitic, draining life from the branches without contributing to the tree’s health.

Branches: Networks collapse under the weight of scams and bad actors, leaving the tree unstable.

Trunk: Trust in the trunk erodes, causing a lack of new nutrients (capital or innovation) to flow upwards.



---

Strategic Lessons from the Tree Metaphor

1. Resilient Trunk: Strengthen the core values of decentralization, transparency, and adaptability.


2. Pruning with Precision: Identify and remove problematic branches or dying leaves early to maintain structural integrity.


3. Adaptive Growth: Foster symbiotic relationships (fungi) that support evolution while resisting parasitism.


4. Roots of Renewal: Focus on long-term sustainability and collaboration, ensuring the roots can withstand external threats like resource scarcity or centralized control.


5. Embrace Fungus as Teachers: Fungi (innovative and regenerative technologies) can teach humanity how to transform challenges into opportunities.

the inevitability of these scenarios underscores the critical importance of foresight, adaptability, and resilience in shaping the trajectory of cryptocurrency and its integration with human society. The tree metaphor, with its organic complexity, captures this interplay beautifully.

Due to the nature of the powers that be and these times we're living through, each dystopian outcome might not just seem daunting, they also are almost certain to occur as many projects will take wrong or misguided approaches.  this will offer opportunities for strategic action and systemic learning. Here’s how the crypto landscape might respond or adapt to these challenges:


---

1. Centralized Control

Path Forward:

Enhanced Privacy Protocols: Develop robust privacy features (e.g., zk-SNARKs) to resist surveillance and centralized power grabs.

Grassroots Advocacy: Encourage crypto education at the community level to empower individuals and counteract government overreach.

Decentralized Governance: Strengthen DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) frameworks to keep decision-making in the hands of users.



---

2. Hyper-Fragmentation

Path Forward:

Cross-Chain Interoperability: Build bridges (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos) to foster collaboration between fragmented networks.

Unified Standards: Encourage industry-wide protocols for interoperability and security.

Economic Incentives for Cooperation: Use tokenomics to reward collaboration between disparate networks.



---

3. AI Exploitation

Path Forward:

Ethical AI Integration: Establish decentralized AI governance frameworks to ensure AI supports humanity rather than undermines it.

Human Oversight: Maintain human involvement in critical decision-making processes to counterbalance AI’s computational power.

Resilient Design: Build blockchains that are robust against potential AI manipulation (e.g., quantum-resistant cryptography).



---

4. Resource Scarcity

Path Forward:

Green Blockchain Technology: Transition from energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work to eco-friendly models like Proof of Stake or Proof of Contribution.

Energy Synergy: Partner with renewable energy providers to create sustainable ecosystems.

Circular Economies: Use blockchain to incentivize recycling and efficient resource management globally.



---

5. Exploitation of Vulnerable Populations

Path Forward:

User Protections: Implement smart contract auditing, fraud prevention mechanisms, and insurance solutions.

Financial Inclusion: Create accessible, low-cost platforms tailored for underserved communities.

Global Standards: Collaborate with international organizations to align crypto innovation with human rights.



---

The Tree’s Response to Dystopia

1. Pruning Misguided Projects: Projects built on exploitative, unsustainable, or incompatible principles will likely fall away like diseased branches, a natural process that strengthens the tree.


2. Cannibalization as Renewal: Failed projects may serve as compost, their lessons learned and technologies absorbed into new, healthier networks.


3. Root Expansion: Even as surface-level conflict ensues, deeper layers (the roots) continue to explore innovative paradigms that transcend current limitations.


4. Symbiosis with Nature: The fungi (regenerative technologies) and microorganisms (innovative ideas) ensure the tree adapts and thrives despite external threats.




---

governments involvement could force a shift in the trunk, reshaping what it means to be part of the tree. Meanwhile, misguided projects will inevitably lead to dead ends or branch collapses. But these collapses also highlight the tree’s resilience—its ability to regenerate and evolve."

This in hindsight has caused further scam accusations directed towards the platform as anyone who voted that Magnus or Ian would win has lost all of their money.

**Now logically one would think that if that two people win, this can be solved by giving both Ian and Magnus yes voters a 100% payout** as they both technically won and the only people losing money would be the people who thought they wouldn't win. However Polymarket is literally incapable of having more than one winner in a market. **If Magnus is marked as the winner Ian will be marked as the loser and if Ian is then marked as the winner - Magnus will be changed to the loser.**

>It is vital that markets prepared on the NegRiskAdapter never result in a tie or will be unable to be determined. For any given market, once one question is resolved as Yes/True, all other questions must be resolved as No/False. This means that if the chosen oracle returns a second question as Yes/True, the call to `reportOutcome` will revert, and the market may not be able to fully resolved. Similarly, it is expected that one question will resolve to Yes/True, and it should not be the case that all questions for a given market resolve to No/False. Keep this in mind when preparing markets and questions on the NegRiskAdapter. [source](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter)

So because Polymarket must have only one winner Polymarket has opted to make the ""other"" option the defacto winner of the World Blitz Chess Championship.

Now this will technically go to UMA to vote if ""Magnus should win"" (Ian has already been marked as a loser) or ""other should win"" but because UMA ""the decentralized Truth Machine"" is decided by two whales  [(seriously)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g06kgs/polymarket_bettors_are_heading_to_trustpilot_to/) who vote as Polymarket tells them, this will resolve as Other, and anyone who voted that either Magnus Carlsen would win or Ian Nepomniachtchi would win, will lose all of their money... even though they both technically won.

EDIT: Other was meant for ""someone not mentioned"" this dropped to .01% because everyone not mentioned had been knocked out by the end of day 1. You can view [this comment and my response](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hr9lmm/comment/m4w5wuc) to get a better idea of what that options was being used for (essentially it was meant for one of the underdogs not listed by name winning).

Old imac that I used to mine on.,1735730899.0,"So recently I've been given my old imac again from when I was in middle school. My parents wanted to do end of year cleaning. However I remember trying out bitcoin mining on this thing many years ago. I remember I set up a wallet and had some software running that would send to the created adress. Does anybody know what files I need to be looking for on an imac? It was around 2012-2013.

I remember back then I was running it for a day and just turning it off after what it only generated. Im curious in today's standards what would be on there.

I wish i just kept it running those many years ago."

Some golden rules for new investors,1735732720.0,"Happy New Year everyone. As a new year begins and new investors enter the crypto market this year like last year, I would like to share a few golden rules with you so that you don't get scammed and lose all your money:

1. Not you keys not your coins. In other words, if you want to invest a lot of money, buy a hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor. Because as long as the coins/tokens (I'll just write coins for the sake of simplicity) are on the broker or exchange, you can lose them if they f\*ck up or the exchange goes bust (see FTX).
   1. If you have a hardware wallet (Cold Wallet) or a wallet created with an app such as Trust Wallet (Hot Wallet), never, absolutely NEVER share your 12 to 24 word phrase with anyone. This is the key to your wallet in the event of loss of login details. Also, do not take screenshots or photos of it that you then save on technical devices of any kind. It has often happened that people have revealed their phrase and had their wallets emptied as a result. Also do an antivirus scan on your devices to remove malware searching for any detail about crypto on your device
   2. Never buy hardware wallets from third-party providers, but only from the manufacturer itself. This is because third-party providers can provide you with hacked devices or devices with a phrase already attached and fake instructions, with which scammers can empty your wallet
2. Always DYOR (do your own research). Dont buy any coins trusting some crappy Youtubers. Many of them either don't know what they are saying or are paid by influencers or developers to advertise for their scamcoin. Also dont participate in anything you dont understund (Trading, Liquidity Pools, Lending, Staking or Leverage). Also be aware of Initial Coin Offers (ICO's). 99% of them are fake and/or scam. 
3. On social media, no one is your friend who wants to give you a hot tip or offer their help with problems. There are a lot of scammers lurking on all platforms. You will often receive DMs after almost every post about cryptocurrencies. Many will approach you in a very subtle and friendly way to suggest that they are not scammers. But they all are. Don't accept their DM request and be aware.
4. Only invest as much money as you can bear to lose. Don't invest money that you need. Diversify your portfolio. Dont invest all of your money into only one coin. 
5. Dont let emotions take control of you. Don't fall for hypes, don't do FOMO (fear of missing out) or lose your nerves if something goes down. The crypto market is very volatile and you have to be able to live with the fact that your portfolio can be down 30% from one day to the next, but you must also not fall into euphoria as soon as your portfolio is up 50%. Try to turn off your greed. As soon as you see something like this, realize profits (unless we are at the beginning of the bull market). Another indicator for selling is when even any crappy page or magazine suddenly starts talking about crypto. It's a bit of a meme, but it has proven to be true more than once. Sometimes its very hard to sell a coin to take profit. Because you sometimes build up an emotional hold on a coin. Just take the profit and never look back at what happened or what could be happen.
6. Do not buy any coins on decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as Uniswap, Raydium, Pancakeswap etc. until you have gained enough experience in the crypto sector in general. There are a lot of scams lurking there that can either empty your wallet because you give them the authorization to do so or fall for a honeypot where you only serve as a provider of liquidity but can no longer sell anything so that the scammer can cash out. 
   1. If you have some experience, then always check the contract adress which you can find on [Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) or [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), before buying a coin. Also check if a coin is a scam on pages like [Token Sniffer](https://tokensniffer.com/). You should also know which DEX runs on which chain. Its a bit more complicated but for example Uniswap runs on the Ethereum Chain. Therefore you won't be able to find coins which run on the Solana chain like PENGU. If you search for PENGU you will get some coins who are named the same but are either different ones or just scams. Always work with the contract adress. And if you are not sure, do research about it at first

So those were my tips for you. If I have forgotten something, please feel free to add it. I wish everyone a healthy new year and lots of profits. Take care"

When to cut losses..,1735786938.0,"Just want to know how everybody handels their positions..

I do always (90% of the time) hold trough a negative period if my entry was bad and it dipped further and eventually sell with profit but since were in a bullmarket and a lot of coins pump every day, I am considering selling some positions with a loss to have funds if something is set to pump.

Currently having positions where my unrealized G/L -300 and -1k is…

Considering to take the -300 to trade other coins alltough im convinced that it will go up and i dont have to sell with a loss.

How do you guys handle it?

Edit: no leverage, just spot"
